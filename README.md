At the World School of Education, we utilize Manim to create videos and slides. Manim is a free and open-source animation engine originally developed by Grant Sanderson. It is now actively maintained by the Manim Community and is released under the MIT License.

This repository serves as our official storage for all Manim-related code. Please note that some of the code may not function correctly with the latest versions of Manim, as updates to the software often introduce changes that can affect compatibility.

For more information about Manim, including its features, updates, and documentation, please visit Manim's official website(https://www.manim.community).

Moreover,We often use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive slides. Additionally, we leverage external libraries like KaTeX(https://katex.org/) for rendering mathematical expressions, and html2canvas(https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) for capturing DOM elements as images. I'm truly grateful for the functionality and flexibility these tools offer.
